When we were looking at pcolor plots of the initial condition, the condition at the final time in Radon space, and the final solution in real space, there seemed to be a speed difference. We were able to determine that that was due to the plotting and looked at the contour plots instead, where there was not a speed difference.

There were some errors that showed up when we were testing this initial condition that weren't there before. More research is needed to fix these errors.
