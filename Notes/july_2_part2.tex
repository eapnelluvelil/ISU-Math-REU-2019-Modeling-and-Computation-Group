%ignoring small eigenvalues

In an attempt to decrease the singularity of our matrix and to get a better transform, we decided to ignore eigenvalues in the matrix below a certain value. In order for the solution to be feasible, we found that $10^{-2}$ was the value that we needed. This gave us quicker results without losing too much definition in our plots.
