We started to code initial conditions for the $P_N$ equations. The following formula is from Minwoo Shin's PhD defence.

\begin{align*}
F(\vec{r}, \vec{\Omega}, 0) = \frac{1}{4\pi\alpha^2}e^{-\frac{x^2+y^2}{4\alpha^2}}
\end{align*}

With 

\begin{align*}
\alpha = 0.03, \quad
\sigma _a = 0, \quad
\sigma _s = 1
\end{align*}

And the final time as one second. The domain that Shin used was $[-1.5, 1.5]$, so we needed to scale this initial condition as well. We set $x = a\tilde{x}$, $y = a\tilde{y}$, $t = a\tilde{t}$, and $C = aC$ where $a = 1.5$. We coded the values $x$, $y$, $\tilde{t}$, and $C$ into our code.
