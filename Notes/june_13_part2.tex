\section*{Radon transform of scaled Gaussians}
Today, Dr. Rossmanith showed us how to compute the Radon transform of a scaled Gaussian.
We know from Dean's textbook that the Radon transform of $f(x, y) = \exp (-(x^{2} + y^{2}))$ is given as follows
\begin{align*}
\hat{f} (s, \omega) & = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(s \cos (\omega) - z \sin (\omega), s \sin (\omega) + z \cos (\omega)) \, dz \\
& = \sqrt{\pi} \exp(-s^{2})
\end{align*}
If we were trying to compute the Radon transform of a scaled Gaussian i.e. the Radon transform of $g(x, y) = \exp (\alpha (x^{2} + y^{2}))$, where $\alpha$ is a positive constant, we can do the following
\begin{align*}
\hat{g} (s, \omega) & = 
\end{align*}
