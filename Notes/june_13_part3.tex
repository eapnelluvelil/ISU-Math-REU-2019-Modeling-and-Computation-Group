As a part of our efforts to find a suitable alternative to the evidently buggy bilinear interpolation, other interpolation schemes were investigated.
Among them was Shepard's method, which in general constructs a global interpolant according to an inverse dsitance weighting.
In our case, each point at which the function needed to be evaluated was placed inside a grid-cell in $s \times \omega$ space, just as in the bilinear case.
Then, the interpolant is constructed based on the function values at those four points only. 
With limited testing, this method appeared to work about as well as the radial basis function attempted the previous day, but at a much cheaper computational cost.
That being said, the method had similar artifacts as well, and was quickly abandonded in place of the angular interpolation method tried next.
