When we ran code over lunch, with our code not creating the matrix but calling on it during each iteration, we determined that it would take a lot longer to run the code this was as opposed to just running the code to create the matrix once. So, we needed to determine how to store the code in an efficient manner. One method that seemed to be a possible way for us to do this was to use h5py which is a python form of accessing HDF5 files. At the end of the day, the code that was written to test h5py wasn't working the way that we expected it to, so there is more work to be done with that.
