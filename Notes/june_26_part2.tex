Today we got the test code to work. So we tested it with $\texttt{radon\_transform\_v1.py}$ and we had a few snags with it, but we got it working. During this time, we discovered that you need to change the dataset name each time you run the code. This could work to our advantage as we could name each dataset as the number of Ns and N$\omega$ points that we have so that we can differentiate between the datasets. \\
We still need to figure out how to read the file and pull in the matrices that we store so that we can use them.
