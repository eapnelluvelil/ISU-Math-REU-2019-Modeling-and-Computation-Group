% Code from yesterday wrap-up

$\quad$To start off today, we were working on the code from yesterday and trying to figure out what we were doing wrong. We started off trying different ways of zeroing out the last row and column of the matrix to see which method was working the best. We eventually figured out that we needed to zero out the last row and column of the matrix before we took the matrix to a power. When we figured this out, we figured out that our code was in fact working, but that the equation that we were using was unstable at the higher orders. Therefore, this equation was useless for what we were trying to accomplish and we were back to square one with finding an equation.
