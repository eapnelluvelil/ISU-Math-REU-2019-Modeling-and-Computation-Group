\section*{Future Work}

For future work, there are a couple of routes that we would suggest.
First, adding spatially dependent collision terms to the $P_N$ equations.
The scope of this project did not cover those terms and assumed that any collision term was zero.
Next, a more sophisticated or higher order time-stepping scheme could be used to reduce any error that may have been encountered.
Finally, parallelization could be used to speed up the code that was written.
This could be accomplished by parallelizing the RT as well as parallelizing the separate angles.
