\section*{Summary}

To summarize the project, the RT was used to bring the $P_N$ equations\cite{BrunnerHolloway:1} into radon space to solve a family of one dimensional PDEs instead of a two or more-dimensional PDE in real space.
Then, transport and time-stepping\cite{PieracciniPuppo:3} was used to solve the hyperbolic PDEs.
Last, the IRT was used to take the solution from radon space back to physical space.
